  abstract = {This cruise is the third of four 30-day bathymetry cruises to the
	margins of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
	Cruises in 2006 and 2007 focused on the West Mariana Ridge whereas
	the 2010 cruises concentrate on sections of the Mariana Trench (Fig.
	1). An exhaustive study of the U.S. data holdings pertinent to the
	formulation of U.S. potential claims of an extended continental shelf
	under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
	identified these areas as regions where new bathymetric surveys are
	needed (Mayer, et al., 2002). That report recommended that multibeam
	echosounder (MBES) data are needed to rigorously define (1) the foot
	of the slope (FoS), a parameter of the two UNCLOS-stipulated formula
	lines, and (2) the 2500-m isobath, a parameter of one of the UNCLOS-stipulated
	cutoff lines. Both of these parameters, the first a precise geodetic
	isobath and second a geomorphic zone, are used to define an extended
	continental shelf claim. In addition, further consideration by the
	ECS Task Force suggested that seamounts accreted to the inner wall
	of the Mariana Trench (Fig. 2) might be used as criteria for a natural
	prolongation of an extended shelf. The Center for Coastal and Ocean
	Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) of the University of
	New Hampshire was directed by the U.S. Congress, through funding
	to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
	to conduct the new surveys and archive the resultant data.
	
	NOAA entered into an agreement with the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office
	(NAVOCEANO) to conduct the bathymetry cruises in 2010. NAVOCEANO
	made available the 329-ft, 5000-ton hydrographic ship USNS Sumner
	(T-AGS-61) (Fig. 3) with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Maritime EM122
	MBES and a Kongsberg Maritime SBP120 chirp sub-bottom profiler. The
	schedule for the cruise called for a 30-day leg beginning and ending
	in Apra Harbor, Guam, Guam.
	
	NAVOCEANO was responsible for system calibration, data collection
	and quality control and overall cruise management whereas the UNH/NOAA
	representative was responsible for cruise planning, both before and
	during the cruises, bathymetry, acoustic- backscatter and chirp subbottom
	profiler processing aboard ship.
	
	The cruise began with a 36-hr, 230-km, data collection and transit
	from Apra Harbor, Guam to an area east of the Mariana Trench. A full
	patch test, including a calibration of an XBT cast with a CTD cast,
	was performed in this area and was followed by 28 days of progressively
	mapping the areas of interest in the Mariana Trench area from north
	to south. The cruise mapped a total of 187,503 km2 in 29 mapping
	days and collected 17,399 line km of MBES with an average speed of
	13.5 knts. A summary of the cruises is given in Table 1.},

  abstract = {The cruise objective was to map the bathymetry of the southern flank
	of the Line Islands in the vicinity of Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll,
	central equatorial Pacific (Fig. 1) for the U.S. Extended Continental
	Shelf (ECS) Task Force. The exhaustive study of the U.S. data holdings
	pertinent to the formulation of U.S. potential claims of an extended
	continental shelf under the United Nations Convention of the Law
	of the Sea (UNCLOS) (Mayer, et al., 2002) identified this area as
	one of the regions where new bathymetric surveys are needed. The
	Mayer et al. (2002) report recommended that multibeam echosounder
	(MBES) data are needed to rigorously define (1) the foot of the slope
	(FoS), a parameter in the two UNCLOS-stipulated formula lines, and
	(2) the 2500- m isobath, a parameter in one of the UNCLOS-stipulated
	cutoff lines. Both of these parameters, the first one a precise geodetic
	isobath and the second one a geomorphic zone, are used to define
	an extended continental shelf claim. The Center for Coastal and Ocean
	Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) of the University of
	New Hampshire was directed by the U.S. Congress, through funding
	to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
	to conduct the new surveys and archive the resultant data.
	
	This area of the Line Islands (Fig. 1) has had no previous systematic
	surveys and only 8 modern bathymetry lines cross the ridge in the
	area of interest. Consequently, the only guide for survey planning
	was the 2010 updated 1-arc minute predicted bathymetry dataset of
	Smith and Sandwell (1997) (http://topex.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/get_data.cgi).
	
	NOAA contracted through NSF-UNOLS (National Science Foundation University
	National Oceanographic Laboratory System) with the University of
	Hawai’i to use their 186-ft, 3060-ton RV Kilo Moana (Fig. 2), a SWATH
	(small water area twin hull) vessel with a newly installed hull-mounted
	Kongsberg EM122 MBES as well as a Knudsen 3260 B/R 3.5-kHz chirp
	sub-bottom profiler and a Carson gravimeter, for the mapping survey.
	
	The UNH chief scientist was responsible for organizing and conducting
	the cruise, as well as collecting and processing the bathymetry,
	acoustic-backscatter and chirp sub- bottom data aboard ship. The
	University of Hawai’i was responsible for the post-cruise processing
	of the gravity data.
	
	The cruise began with a one-day transit to Pago Pago, American Samoa
	because no fuel was available in Western Samoa. After fueling, a
	4.5 day, 2250 km, transit from Pago Pago, American Samoa to a deep-water
	area within the survey region (Fig. 1). A full patch test, including
	a calibration of the XBT system with a CTD cast, was performed here.	The
	next 22 days consisted of systematically mapping the southern flank
	of this area of the Line Islands. The cruise ended with 3.5 day 2000
	km, 1800 km, transit to Honolulu, HI. The cruise mapped a total of
	107,435 km2 in 22 survey days and collected 9942 line km of MBES
	lines with an average speed of 11.6 knts. A summary of the cruises
	is given in Table 1.},
