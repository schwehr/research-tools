  abstract = {This cruise is the third of four 30-day bathymetry cruises to the
	margins of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
	Cruises in 2006 and 2007 focused on the West Mariana Ridge whereas
	the 2010 cruises concentrate on sections of the Mariana Trench (Fig.
	1). An exhaustive study of the U.S. data holdings pertinent to the
	formulation of U.S. potential claims of an extended continental shelf
	under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
	identified these areas as regions where new bathymetric surveys are
	needed (Mayer, et al., 2002). That report recommended that multibeam
	echosounder (MBES) data are needed to rigorously define (1) the foot
	of the slope (FoS), a parameter of the two UNCLOS-stipulated formula
	lines, and (2) the 2500-m isobath, a parameter of one of the UNCLOS-stipulated
	cutoff lines. Both of these parameters, the first a precise geodetic
	isobath and second a geomorphic zone, are used to define an extended
	continental shelf claim. In addition, further consideration by the
	ECS Task Force suggested that seamounts accreted to the inner wall
	of the Mariana Trench (Fig. 2) might be used as criteria for a natural
	prolongation of an extended shelf. The Center for Coastal and Ocean
	Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) of the University of
	New Hampshire was directed by the U.S. Congress, through funding
	to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
	to conduct the new surveys and archive the resultant data.
	
	NOAA entered into an agreement with the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office
	(NAVOCEANO) to conduct the bathymetry cruises in 2010. NAVOCEANO
	made available the 329-ft, 5000-ton hydrographic ship USNS Sumner
	(T-AGS-61) (Fig. 3) with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Maritime EM122
	MBES and a Kongsberg Maritime SBP120 chirp sub-bottom profiler. The
	schedule for the cruise called for a 30-day leg beginning and ending
	in Apra Harbor, Guam, Guam.
	
	NAVOCEANO was responsible for system calibration, data collection
	and quality control and overall cruise management whereas the UNH/NOAA
	representative was responsible for cruise planning, both before and
	during the cruises, bathymetry, acoustic- backscatter and chirp subbottom
	profiler processing aboard ship.
	
	The cruise began with a 36-hr, 230-km, data collection and transit
	from Apra Harbor, Guam to an area east of the Mariana Trench. A full
	patch test, including a calibration of an XBT cast with a CTD cast,
	was performed in this area and was followed by 28 days of progressively
	mapping the areas of interest in the Mariana Trench area from north
	to south. The cruise mapped a total of 187,503 km2 in 29 mapping
	days and collected 17,399 line km of MBES with an average speed of
	13.5 knts. A summary of the cruises is given in Table 1.},

	of the Line Islands in the vicinity of Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll,
	central equatorial Pacific (Fig. 1) for the U.S. Extended Continental
	Shelf (ECS) Task Force. The exhaustive study of the U.S. data holdings
	pertinent to the formulation of U.S. potential claims of an extended

	of the Sea (UNCLOS) (Mayer, et al., 2002) identified this area as

	New Hampshire was directed by the U.S. Congress, through funding
	to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
	to conduct the new surveys and archive the resultant data.
	
	This area of the Line Islands (Fig. 1) has had no previous systematic
	surveys and only 8 modern bathymetry lines cross the ridge in the
	area of interest. Consequently, the only guide for survey planning
	was the 2010 updated 1-arc minute predicted bathymetry dataset of
	Smith and Sandwell (1997) (http://topex.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/get_data.cgi).
	
	NOAA contracted through NSF-UNOLS (National Science Foundation University
	National Oceanographic Laboratory System) with the University of
	Hawai’i to use their 186-ft, 3060-ton RV Kilo Moana (Fig. 2), a SWATH
	(small water area twin hull) vessel with a newly installed hull-mounted
	Kongsberg EM122 MBES as well as a Knudsen 3260 B/R 3.5-kHz chirp
	sub-bottom profiler and a Carson gravimeter, for the mapping survey.
	
	The UNH chief scientist was responsible for organizing and conducting
	the cruise, as well as collecting and processing the bathymetry,
	acoustic-backscatter and chirp sub- bottom data aboard ship. The
	University of Hawai’i was responsible for the post-cruise processing
	of the gravity data.
	
	The cruise began with a one-day transit to Pago Pago, American Samoa
	because no fuel was available in Western Samoa. After fueling, a
	4.5 day, 2250 km, transit from Pago Pago, American Samoa to a deep-water
	area within the survey region (Fig. 1). A full patch test, including
	a calibration of the XBT system with a CTD cast, was performed here.The
	next 22 days consisted of systematically mapping the southern flank
	of this area of the Line Islands. The cruise ended with 3.5 day 2000
	km, 1800 km, transit to Honolulu, HI. The cruise mapped a total of
	107,435 km2 in 22 survey days and collected 9942 line km of MBES
	lines with an average speed of 11.6 knts. A summary of the cruises
	is given in Table 1.},

  abstract = {he first proposal for the Receiver Independent Exchange Format RINEX
	was developed by the Astro- nomical Institute of the University of
	Berne for the easy exchange of the GPS data to be collected during
	the first large European GPS campaign EUREF 89, which involved more
	than 60 GPS receivers of 4 different manufacturers. The governing
	aspect during the development was the following fact:
	
	Most geodetic processing software for GPS data use a well-defined
	set of observables:
	
	-the carrier-phase measurement at one or both carriers (actually being
	a measurement on the beat fre- quency between the received carrier
	of the satellite signal and a receiver-generated reference fre- quency).
	
	-the pseudorange (code) measurement, equivalent to the difference
	of the time of reception (ex- pressed in the time frame of the receiver)
	and the time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the
	satellite) of a distinct satellite signal.
	
	-the observation time being the reading of the receiver clock at the
	instant of validity of the carrier- phase and/or the code measurements.
	
	Usually the software assumes that the observation time is valid for
	both the phase and the code measure- ments, and for all satellites
	observed.},

	Welcome to the latest version of NOS Hydrographic Surveys Specifications
	and Deliverables document. These technical specifications detail
	the requirements for hydrographic surveys to be undertaken either
	by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) field units
	or by organizations under contract to the Director, Office of Coast
	Survey (OCS), National Ocean Service (NOS), NOAA, U.S. Department
	of Commerce. As there have been both minor and major edits throughout
	this new edition, it would be in the best interest to those that
	expect to acquire hydrographic survey data in accordance to NOS specifications,
	to use the current version. Please submit questions and comments
	through the Coast Survey's Inquiry Page.
	
	
	These technical specifications detail the requirements for hydrographic
	surveys to be undertaken either by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
	Administration (NOAA) field units or by organizations under contract
	to the Director, Office of Coast Survey (OCS), National Ocean Service
	(NOS), NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce.
	
	The specifications described herein are based in part on the International
	Hydrographic Organization’s Standards for Hydrographic Surveys, Special
	Publication 44, Fifth Edi- tion, February 2008, specifically for
	Order 1a surveys. Hydrographic surveys classified as Order 1a are
	intended for harbors, harbor approach channels, recommended tracks,
	inland navigation channels, coastal areas of high commercial traffic
	density, and are usually in shallower areas less than 100 meters
	water depth. Additional details for the specific project areas, including
	any modifications to the specifications in this manual, will be provided
	in Hydrographic Survey Project Instructions for NOAA field units
	or the Statement of Work for contractors.
	
	If a hydrographer has any questions on the interpretation of these
	Specifications or feels that there may be a “better way” to provide
	a deliverable, they should contact the COTR or appropriate NOAA Program
	Office to discuss and clarify the issue. The Specifications will
	continue to evolve and can only improve with the input of all users.},

	The Office of Coast Survey, Hydrographic Surveys Division, Field Procedures
	Manual (FPM), is a consolidated source of current best practices
	and standard operating procedures for NOAA field units conducting,
	processing, and generating hydrographic survey field deliverables.
	
	The goal of the FPM is to provide NOAA field units with consolidated
	and standardized guidelines that can be used to meet the specifications
	set forth in the “NOS Hydrographic Surveys Specifications and Deliverables”.
	The FPM covers in detail: system preparation and maintenance, including
	annual readiness review and periodic quality assurance of hardware
	and software systems; survey planning including safety considerations
	and project instructions; data acquisition, including sonar, horizontal
	and vertical control, and ancillary data; data analysis including
	software configuration and standard processing steps; data management,
	including storage and security; and final field deliverables, including
	digital and analog data and project reports. The FPM is a valuable
	resource and reference document for field hydrographers, technicians,
	coxswains, officers, and all others involved in hydrographic survey
	field work.
	
	Like the “NOS Hydrographic Surveys Specifications and Deliverables”,
	the Field Procedures Manual is a living document. Rapid developments
	in technology and improvements in operational methods requires the
	continued maintenance of the FPM. Field units are actively encouraged
	to submit user input and recommended changes are reviewed bi-annually
	by committee. New procedures established between editions are implemented
	internally via technical directives.},
