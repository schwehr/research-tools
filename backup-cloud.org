* Introduction

Keeping your data safe is super critical.  Your job is important and
the raw data and what you create is supper important.  If what you are
doing is not worth saving, why are you doing it?  (Yes, there are
definitely cases where you don't want to save data and what you are
doing is important.)

When it comes to the cloud, it is both a huge win and a massive
liability.  What if the web service goes away?  You have no recourse.
What if your account gets destroyed?  What if your data gets exposed
because of their lack of security?  What if a government wants access
to the content.  And worse for marine scientists... what if you are at sea?

There are huge numbers of competing services, but these should get you
started thinking about what is possible.
