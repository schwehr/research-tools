* Reminder to log in to the IRC                                         :irc:

Please *only* use the Ubuntu virtual machine in class today.  There is
too much confusion when switching between Windows and Ubuntu.

Make sure to not use "researchtools" as your login name for the IRC channel!

* Introduction

Today, we will start off with a little more background on where to
find material.  We will look at man pages online and the Safari Technical
Books.  Last time, the question was asked how to find out about what
software is available and which is already installed.  There is a
section on that, but I will leave it to you to read outside of class.

Next, we will dive into taking notes with emacs org-mode.  I take most
of my work notes in org-mode and some students use it to keep track of
the their research and draft material for their thesis.  All of the
lecture notes for this class and the homework assignments are written
in org-mode format.

*HOMEWORK*:  The end of this document links to homework due on
Thursday.  Please pay close attention to detail when doing the
homework.

* Emacs and org-mode reference cards

Print these double sided:

- http://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf
- [[http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/Classes/2011/esci895-researchtools/docs/emacs23-refcard.pdf][emacs23-refcard.pdf]]

In the virtual machine, you can open either of these links:

- [[file:/usr/share/emacs/23.2/etc/refcards/refcard.pdf][/usr/share/emacs/23.2/etc/refcards/refcard.pdf]]
- [[/usr/share/doc/org-mode/org.pdf.gz]]

Or run these commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xdg-open /usr/share/emacs/23.2/etc/refcards/refcard.pdf
xdg-open /usr/share/doc/org-mode/org.pdf.gz
#+END_SRC

* Ubuntu man pages online                                               :man:

Sometimes you have a second computer next to you when working. One of
the many ways that you can take advantage of that computer by using it
to view "man pages".  Ubuntu has the man pages online.  We are using
"Ubuntu 11.04" during this class, but man pages for other versions
should be very similar.

http://manpages.ubuntu.com/

Try searching for =minmax=. If you use the search box in the top left,
you will be taken to a menu of Ubuntu versions.  Select 11.04 and you
will be taken to this page:

http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/en/man1/minmax.1gmt.html

* Technical/Computer Online Books at UNH - Safari

[[http://safaribooksonline.com][Safari Books Online]] provides technical books online.  UNH has a
subscription, so if you are a student, staff or faculty at UNH, you
can get access to a wide range of technical books.  If you are not at
UNH and your job does not provide the service, you can sign up for 
a personal account.  This can save you a lot of money over buying a
large number of books.  However, I do not think that you can take
these with you off line and I still like "dead tree" books (aka the
real thing).

- Click "Library" Tab
- Click "Connect to Databases" Link - http://www.library.unh.edu/researchtools/databases/index.shtml
- Click "[S-T]"
- Click on "Safari Books Online"

You should now be able to get access to a very large number of books.
Some books that might be useful for this lecture '''NOTE:''' I have
not necessarily read these books.

* A quick look at Ubuntu and Software                       :ubuntu:sysadmin:

There have been questions in class as to how to find out which
software is installed.  I'll give you a quick intruduction here.

** Which version of Linux?

First, how do you find out which version of linux you are using?  Most
linux systems have a file that describes the version of linux.  It's
usually a "release" file in the /etc directory.  "etc" is a directory
tree that contains most of the system wide settings.  On Redhat and
CentOS Linux systems, there is a /etc/redhad-release file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls -l /etc/*release
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 27 Apr 25  2010 /etc/redhat-release

cat /etc/redhat-release 
CentOS release 5.5 (Final)

cat /etc/issue
CentOS release 5.5 (Final)
Kernel \r on an \m
#+END_SRC

Ubuntu and any other system that follows the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base][Linux Standard Base (LSB)]] guidelines for Linux have one or both of two
files named
/etc/lsb-release and /etc/issue that document the version of the system:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 11.04

cat /etc/lsb-release 
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=11.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=natty
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 11.04"
#+END_SRC

** Command line exploration of software on the system and available for install

There are many different ways to look at the software on a Ubuntu
computer, but this is the way that I go about it.

First, what is installed?

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
researchtools@ubuntu:~$ dpkg --get-selections | wc -l
1789

dpkg --get-selections | head
adduser						install
apel						install
apparmor					install
apparmor-utils					install
apport						install
apport-symptoms					install
apt						install
apt-transport-https				install
apt-utils					install
apt-xapian-index				install

dpkg --get-selections | grep emacs
emacs						install
emacs-jabber					install
emacs23						install
emacs23-bin-common				install
emacs23-common					install
emacsen-common					install
python-ropemacs					install
#+END_SRC

If you want to read through them all, use a pager (e.g. more, less or most):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dpkg --get-selections | less
#+END_SRC

If you know a package that is installed, you can use listfiles option
to dpkg.  A common task is to list the programs available in a package.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dpkg --listfiles gmt | grep bin | head
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/GMT
/usr/lib/gmt/bin
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/gmt_shell_functions.sh
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/gmtget
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/gmtlogo
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/isogmt
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/psbbox.sh
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/blockmean
/usr/lib/gmt/bin/blockmedian
#+END_SRC

If you would like to know which package a file belongs to, you can ask
the system.  We can combine that with the command =type= that tells
you where in your path a program is located.  For example, the sudo command
that gives you access to administrator capabilities (aka "root").  The
"hashed" means that the shell has an internal table of commands to
speed up searching.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
type sudo
sudo is hashed (/usr/bin/sudo)

dpkg --search /usr/bin/sudo
sudo: /usr/bin/sudo
#+END_SRC

There are also an interactive text based program to examine packages
without a full graphical interface:

* Introduction to Emacs                                       :emacs:orgmode:

Emacs is a very powerful text editing environment.  It is the editor
that I use for writing this class, for programming, and many other
tasks.  As you use emacs, you will discover that that many of the
shortcuts in emacs have been adopted by other programs (especially
bash).

I got started in seriously using an electronic work log in 2004 at the
suggestion of [[http://humansystemdebugging.blogspot.com/][Anne Wright]], while I was working at NASA JPL.  Paper
logs are really helpful, but they are hard to search.

We will start out jumping right into writing a log in emacs.  I use
emacs [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to keep most of my work logs.  I don't use as many
features of org-mode as I would like, but it really pushes me to take
better notes.  I started using org-mode for my work log in 2010 (I
found some old notes files and have since converted them into org
mode.  e.g. 1998, 2000, and 2001).

From the number of lines of log files, you can see that I take
electronic logs very seriously.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
wc -l kurt-????.{txt,org}
     192 kurt-1998.org
     149 kurt-2000.org
     327 kurt-2001.org
      62 kurt-2002.txt
     475 kurt-2003.txt
   12139 kurt-2004.txt
    6644 kurt-2005.txt
   19332 kurt-2006.txt
   28292 kurt-2007.txt
   28746 kurt-2008.txt
   18740 kurt-2009.txt
   30945 kurt-2010.org
   21929 kurt-2011.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

Org-mode is much more useful than just straight text.  It can produce
a table of contents and helps me keep a much more organized log.

[[file:./figures/org-mode-example-entry.png]]

** Initial setup

I missed one emacs package that we need for today in the Virtual
Machine.  Without a package called htmlize, org-mode output will not
have code colored.  It is a part of the emacs goodies package.
texlive is used to produce PDF documents.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install emacs-goodies-el
sudo apt-get install texlive
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
#+END_SRC

** Opening files

I will give an introduction to using emacs for basic files here.  This
really needs a video of the section to show what I'm doing.

- opening a directory
- searching with C-s

** Basic org-mode - outlining

The format for org-mode is very similar to Mediawiki.  However, the
characters used to mark up the text are slightly different.  There are
large numbers of markup languages, but we will ignore the others right
now.

Start by opening a new org mode file.  Org-mode starts by default if
the file name ends in ".org".  "File" -> "Visit New File" and pick
type in "example.org".

An alternative approach is to use the keyboard shortcut:  

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
C-x C-f example.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

At the bottom of the window, you will see:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
--:--- example.org All L1 (Org)------------
#+END_EXAMPLE

You are staring at a blank page, but there are helpers under the "Org"
and "Tbl" (meaning table) menus that just appeared at the top of the
Window.  Select =Org= -> =New Heading=.  You will see a "*" appear.
Headings are made up of 1 or more "*" characters followed by the text.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
* Introduction
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sub-headings have two like this: 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
** This is a sub heading
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can type paragraphs in any heading or sub-heading.

Lists start with "-".  A list
looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
- first item
- another item
- yet another
#+END_EXAMPLE

The list will look like this:

- first item
- another item
- yet another

** Seeing the results?

But how do we see what the results are???  We have to "publish" or
"export" the document.  There are many formats, but we will start with
HTML.

"Org" -> "Export/Publish"

You will now see lots of options for the output.  Start off by trying
"export as HTML and open in browser".  

Press the letter "b"

You now should see Firefox open up and show the file "example.html".

You can also export to a pdf:

"Org" -> "Export/Publish" -> press "d"

** Tables

Tables are built with the vertical "|" character.  Entries with all
"---" characters create horizontal rulers.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
| Column header  | something else           |
|----------------+--------------------------|
| hello          | world                    |
| a second entry | what do you want to say? |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Would look like this:

| Column header  | something else           |
|----------------+--------------------------|
| hello          | world                    |
| a second entry | what do you want to say? |

** Examples and source code

You can also create example blocks and source code blocks.  Inside of
an example, it will not show the normal formatting.  Try this:

: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
: * This is a heading
: #+END_EXAMPLE
