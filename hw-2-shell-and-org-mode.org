* This assignment is due Thurs by 5PM EDT
  DEADLINE: <2011-09-22 Thu 17:00>

* Introduction

Homework 1 had you create a CCOM wiki page.  Much of the homework for
the rest of the class will be in emacs org-mode.  You will submit your
homework as an emacs org-mode file and an exported HTML file as a tar
with the proper file name.  Make sure to mark all TODO items as DONE.
Make sure to fill in all sections.  Mark all check boxes when you
complete them.

Put your answers in the appropriate "#+BEGIN\_SRC" or "#+VERSE"
sections when they are in the homework. 

Some questions may start with a "- [ ]". Fill in the line and use =C-c
C-c= to mark the check box as done.

*NOTE:* You should complete this assignment on your own first.
But it is okay to check over each other's completed assignments.  I
strongly recommend that you have another classmate check your work.

This assignment depends on attention to detail.

* TODO Download and get started

- [ ] Log in to your virtual machine
- [ ] Open a terminal
- [ ] =mkdir -p hw/2=
- [ ] =cd hw/2=
- [ ] =wget http://tinyurl.com/hw-2-shell-and-org-mode-dotorg=
- [ ] =mv hw-2-shell-and-org-mode-dotorg hw-2-shell-and-org-mode.org=
- [ ] start emacs and open the homework

Or if you want to do less typing, you can replace the wget and mv
command with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget --output-file=hw-2-shell-and-org-mode.org http://tinyurl.com/3fjdphv 
#+END_SRC

* TODO A little org mode intro

This is what inline questions look like.  The first question is
answered for you and marked as complete.

- [X] What is the CCOM website?
      http://ccom.unh.edu
- [ ] What is the website for the operating system we are using in
  this class inside of the virtual machine?
- [ ] What is the URL for the Wikipedia Entry on Multibeam Sonars?

* TODO Fill in your name and email at the top

If you don't put your name on your homework, even if sending it to me
and naming the files approriately, I will deduct points.

Go to the top of this file and do the following:

- [ ] Replace "FIX: your name" with your name
- [ ] Replace "FIX: your email" with your email address.  This must be
  UNH or NOAA address, or no points.
- [ ] Replace the date line just under those two with the current date.

* TODO Shell basics

** TODO download the example data

Download this file using wget:
http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/Classes/2011/esci895-researchtools/examples/2007-boston-construction.csv.bz2

Place the command inside the "SRC" and the results inside of the
example.  I will do the first one for you.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/Classes/2011/esci895-researchtools/examples/2007-boston-construction.csv.bz2
#+END_SRC

* TODO Save your org-mode homework file!

If you do not save the org-mode file you are working on before
creating the submission, the HTML will be fine, but your org-mode file
will not show your completed home.  Save your file with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
C-x C-s
#+END_EXAMPLE

* TODO Creating your homework submission

Follow this section very carefully.  You should be creating a
submission that is layed out exactly as I have done.

** TODO Check your assignment to make sure it is complete

Use the emacs search command for the string "FIX:".  The only place
where this string should be in your org-mode homework 2 file is in
this section and the two list check boxes that talk about filling in
your name, email, and the date.  I use that string to mark sections
where you need to be replacing it with something.

Searching starts by holding =Control= and pressing =s= (written C-s).
Then type what you want to search for. In this case, type "FIX:"
(without the quotes). To search for the next instance of the string,
press =C-s= again.  When you get to the end of the file, press =C-s=
again and it will jump to the top of the document.

** TODO Build the submission                                  :tar:bzip2:md5:

*WARNING*: If you properly follow this section, the "TODO" above and
any TODO or [ ] markers below will be left unflagged inside of the
tar.  They are included to help you work through the process.

First create an HTML export of your assignment.  In emacs you can
type =C-c C-e=.  Remember to hold down the =control= key and press the
letter that follows the dash.  You should now see the list of org
export formats.  Press the letter =b= and you should see Firefox open
up and show you your homework.  The full command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
C-c C-e b
#+END_EXAMPLE

Switch back to the terminal.  You should be in ~/hw/2.  You will now
create your submission.  Replace YOURNAME with your user name.
*NOTE:* If you don't remember your username, it is what you used to log
into researchtools.

First, build the directory tree:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir hw2-YOURNAME
cp hw-2-shell-and-org-mode.org hw2-YOURNAME/hw2-YOURNAME.org
cp hw-2-shell-and-org-mode.html hw2-YOURNAME/hw2-YOURNAME.html
#+END_SRC

Verify that your homework submission looks correct.  It should look
something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls -l hw2-YOURNAME/
total 20
-rw-r--r-- 1 researchtools researchtools 11904 2011-09-16 05:57 hw2-YOURNAME.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 researchtools researchtools  4740 2011-09-16 05:57 hw2-YOURNAME.org
#+END_SRC

Now we need to create a "tar" archive of your homework:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tar cf hw2-YOURNAME.tar hw2-YOURNAME
#+END_SRC

Verify the contents of your tar:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tar tfvv hw2-YOURNAME.tar
drwxr-xr-x researchtools/researchtools 0 2011-09-16 05:57 hw2-YOURNAME/
-rw-r--r-- researchtools/researchtools 4740 2011-09-16 05:57 hw2-YOURNAME/hw2-YOURNAME.org
-rw-r--r-- researchtools/researchtools 11904 2011-09-16 05:57 hw2-YOURNAME/hw2-YOURNAME.html
#+END_SRC

Compress your tar archive using bzip2 with maximum compression

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bzip2 -9 hw2-YOURNAME.tar
#+END_SRC

Compute the md5 checksum. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
md5sum hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2
57e88b90db260511eee305108d0b2d91  hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2
#+END_SRC

*NOTE:* Your checksum will be different!!!!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
57e88b90db260511eee305108d0b2d91  hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2
#+END_EXAMPLE

The ">" character redirects the output from the screen to a file.
Save that md5 sum to a file.  Put the checksum in a file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
md5sum hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2 > hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2.md5
#+END_SRC

** Push the files to the researchtools server using scp                 :scp:

Use the secure copy command to copy your files from the virtual
machine to the researchtools server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
scp hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2* YOURNAME@researchtools.ccom.nh:
#+END_SRC

You will see this the first time that you ssh or scp to a computer
from a new computer or account.  Each computer has a unique signature
that should not change.  When you say yes here, the computer will
record the host signature.  If the host key changes, ssh or scp will
warn you loudly about it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The authenticity of host 'researchtools.ccom.nh (192.168.2.28)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 16:c1:64:32:da:23:b9:58:0a:87:06:5b:05:1a:c5:35.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

YOURNAME@researchtools.ccom.nh's password: 
hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2                                    100% 4705     4.6KB/s   00:00

#+END_EXAMPLE

** Setup your researchtools homework area

Use =ssh= to log into the researchtools server.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
ssh YOURNAME@researchtools.ccom.nh
The authenticity of host 'researchtools.ccom.nh (192.168.2.28)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 16:c1:64:32:da:23:b9:58:0a:87:06:5b:05:1a:c5:35.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
#+END_EXAMPLE

Make sure you are actually logged in to researchtools.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo $HOSTNAME
researchtools
#+END_SRC

Setup your homework area, unpack your homework, and move the tar to
the "hw" directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir hw
cd hw
tar xf ~/hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2
mv ../hw2-YOURNAME.tar.bz2 .
#+END_SRC

Verify that your homework is in place.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls -la hw2-YOURNAME/
total 28

#+END_SRC

** Tell your instructor that your homework is done

Email me from your UNH email account (no hotmail/gmail/yahoo/etc
email) with the subject line "research tools homework 2".

My email address is [[mailto:kurt@ccom.unh.edu][kurt@ccom.unh.edu]]

In the email, include the md5 sum of your .tar.bz2 archive.  I will
then log into researchtools to check on your homework.  I will compute
the md5 sum of your tar.

*DO NOT* put the tar or .md5 file in the email.  Only copy the md5 sum
and filename in the email.

Include these in the email:

- [ ] your tar file name
- [ ] the text of the md5 checksum
