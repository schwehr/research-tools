* Introduction

Writing good bug reports is hard.  The goal is to maximize the chances
that you will quickly get your problem resolved.  Too little
information and the person that receives your bug report will have no
idea how to help you and too much information will mean that the key
information will likely be ignored.  Each iteration though the process
of getting help takes time and energy.  This is exacerbated when you
are at sea.  You might be as much as 12 time zones away from help and
very likely you have limited internet and phone.  Additionally, IT and
other people that you are asking for help are likely to get pummeled
by frustrated users - even when the issues are not necessarily your fault.
