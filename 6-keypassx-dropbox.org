* Introduction

Today we will

* Managing passwords with KeePassX                       :keepassx:passwords:

[[http://www.keepassx.org/][KeyPassX]] is a cross platform password manager that encrypts the data
before saving it to disk.  You can download a Windows or Mac version
of the software [[http://www.keepassx.org/downloads][here]].  The software is already installed in your Linux
virtual machine.

There are other alternatives to KeyPassX, such as [[https://agilebits.com/products/1Password][1Password]].  They do
not support linux, but give you a web version: [[http://help.agile.ws/1Password3/support_non_mac.html][1Password Support For Linux]].
KeyPassX is not available on the iPhone/iPad/Android devices, so if
you have the Money, you might consider a tool like 1Password.

** Setup KeyPassX

First add a quick link to the Panel across the top of Ubuntu.  Right
click on the gray bar at the top of the display and select "Add to
Panel...".  Double click "Application Launcher..." (the 2nd item from
the top).  Click the small arrow to the left of "Accessories", select
KeePassX, and "Add".  You can now close the "Add to Panel" tool.

Start KeePassX.  Select "File" -> "New Database".  You now need to
create a "Master Key".  This is the one password that will give you
access to all the other passwords.  If you forget this password, you
will loose all your passwords!!!!  

Save the KeePassX database!  I named mine with my name.  Later we will
move this file to your DropBox file to share it with other computers
that you use, but for now, put it in your home directory.

The program lets you organize passwords into groups.  I have a number
of passwords associated with CCOM systems and you do too.  Let's
create a group called "CCOM".  "Groups" -> "Add New Group...".  For
title, put "CCOM".  You can pick what ever icon you wish.

Select the CCOM group.

You can now create password entries for web pages, computers, and
other software.  I also often put license keys for software in as
entries.  "Entries" -> "Add New Entry"

Now create an entry for the virtual machine:

| Field    | Value                                |
|----------+--------------------------------------|
| Title    | Virtual Machine, Research Tools 2011 |
| Username | researchtools                        |
| URL      |                                      |
| Password | !rt2011vm                            |
| Comment  | I also created my own user called "" |

Now create an entry for your CCOM wiki account and your regular CCOM
account.

** Unique passwords for each account

You should always use a different password for each service or login
system that you use.  It is very hard to come up with unique passwords
for each system.  You also need to change your password periodically.
This gets extremely challenging to do.  KeyPassX can help!  It has a
"Generate" function to create random passwords.  

Create a new entry called "test".  To the right of the "Repeat" entry
for passwords, there is a "Gen" button.  Press that and you will see a
"Password Generator" tool appear.  You can control the length of the
password and which characters will be in the password.  The best
possible password will be long and have characters from every
category.  Select all the types and the ensure to use all character
groups check boxes.  Set the password length to 25 characters.  Press
the eye icon to let you see the results and then press generate.  You
will see something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
Jbzc }K#/q!_ -N8c24QsS@z#
#+END_EXAMPLE

You are not going to be able to remember this password, but it is
super secure.  However, if you need to type the password into an iOS
(iphone/ipad) or Android device, you are going to go crazy.  A
reasonable compromise for accounts where that is necessary is to pick
lower letters and numbers with 15 characters.  For example, I got:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
4ox3oc2ejc7lx1u
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you will have to remember the password without KeePassX, you can
pick your own password or try the "Pronouceable" tab.  For example, I
got:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
nuOsackujBeDren
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Make sure to save

After you create, modify or delete any entry, make sure to save!

* Setting up drop box                                                 :cloud:

Being able share files easily can make or break your work.  There are
many many services to automatically sync files between computers.
There are many of these services:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_backup_services

As a student at UNH, you have access to a Microsoft Live [[http://skydrive.live.com][SkyDrive]] with
25GB of space via [[http://studentemail.unh.edu/?q=content/skydrive][WildcatsMail! SkyDrive]].  However, this service only
supports Linux via a web browser.  Be warned, faculty and staff do not
have access to a SkyDrive through UNH, so they might not have
experience with it if you need help.

Common services that support Linux are:

- https://www.jungledisk.com/
- http://www.sugarsync.com/
- https://spideroak.com/

One of the most popular services is DropBox.  If you do not have a
drop box account, you can either click this link below (this will both
you and me a referal credit) or if you have someone else who can send
you a referral, then you can both get a little extra free storage
space over the default 2GB free account.  If you have a .edu email
address, be sure to use that email address as dropbox gives more space
to education accounts.  

** Limitations of dropbox

Sadly, if you don't have internet, dropbox will not work.  Even if you
have multiple machines on a ship network that can talk to each other,
dropbox does not currently support synchronization unless it can talk
back to the company's main servers.  There are other ways to share
files on a ship than range from mounting network drives, to portable
drives/usb sticks, and more.

It is possible that some of the OpenSource alternatives to DropBox
that are being developed may become useful in restricted network
environments, but I cannot yet offer any advice.  See for example:

- http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/06/16/1618206/Open-Source-Alternative-To-Dropbox
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheevaPlug

** Security warning for cloud storage

Remember that this is a company storing your files on their servers.
They have a privacy policy that says they will not look at your files,
but that does not guarantee that they will not be hacked or that a
government agency might force them to reveal your files.
Additionally, it might be illegal to save certain types of data to the
cloud (for example, confidential personal data or restricted data such
as ITAR controlled material).

Think before putting files into a cloud drive!!!

You can encrypt data before putting into the service for extra
protection.  For example, KeyPassX does not store your raw passwords,
so it should be safe for use with DropBox.

An example of one of the security issues:

** Creating an account

This is my referral link.  Please feel free to use a referral from
someone else.

http://db.tt/qj5etLX 

NOTE: I am not sure if it really is okay for a professor to give out a
referral URL in class.  If you are not comfortable with that, get a
referral from someone you know has dropbox.

You can get extra space by referring other people you know (be warned
that other people might not appreciate the invite).
Once you have signed in, make sure to go to this address to verify
that are getting credit for your educational account and to get extra
free space.

https://www.dropbox.com/edu

You can pay for more space if you desire, but for this class, I am
assuming that you only have the base free account.  You will not need
more space than that for the class.

** Installing Drop Box

WARNING: If you use these notes after  September 2011, there is like a
newer version of dropbox.  You will want to skip to the next section
and download dropbox through a web browser.

If dropbox is not installed in your virtual machine (my first version
of the Ubuntu VM does *not* have dropbox), you need to install it.
This is not open source software, so you will have to go through a 
different process for normal software in Ubuntu.  First you will need
to download an Ubuntu package from here:

https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?os=lnx

You will need to get the 32-bit Ubuntu version (referred to as "x86 .deb")

e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget --output-document=nautilus-dropbox_0.6.9_i386.deb https://www.dropbox.com/download?dl=packages/nautilus-dropbox_0.6.9_i386.deb
#+END_SRC

It is a good idea to verify that what we downloaded is what we
expected.  First, we can use the file command from the last class to
ask if it knows what type of file this is:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
file *.deb
nautilus-dropbox_0.6.9_i386.deb: Debian binary package (format 2.0)
#+END_SRC

We will talk more about checksums, but there the basic idea is that
you can run an algorithm on the contents of a file to make sure that
the file probably contains the same bytes that you expect it to.  The
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5][md5 algorithm]] is one of the most commonly used today.  Give it a try
and see if you get the same results:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
md5sum *.deb
64f62fc8921d9ddc1b24c2b911c48921  nautilus-dropbox_0.6.9_i386.deb
#+END_SRC

If you were able to download the deb correctly, you can skip the next
step.  If you got a file that did not match, you will need to try to
download the deb via a web browser in the next section.

** Getting dropbox via a web browser

If you are working through these notes after September 2011, you will
like be facing a newer version of the "deb" package.  Get it via a web
browser inside of your virtual machine (e.g. using Firefox).

https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?os=lnx

This virtual machine is a 32-bit Ubuntu image, so you want to get the
'''Ubuntu (x86 .deb)''' version.  "x86_64" implies an Intel processor
in 64 bit mode.

[[file:figures/dropbox-ubuntu.jpg]]

** run the installer

Then you need to install the software:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dpkg -i nautilus-dropbox_0.6.9_i386.deb
#+END_SRC

Answer yes to what it asks and then click the button to "Restart
Nautilus".  Click the "Next" button.  Then click "Start Dropbox".  You
can then sign in and dropbox will start to synchronize your files.
There will now be a icon on the top right of your screen that is
supposed to look like a box with an open top.  This will give you a
short cut to see what files have recently been changed in your account
and see other dropbox functions.

'''NOTE:''' you can just stick with the 2GB free account.

* Finish up

You now need to put your keypassx database into dropbox.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mv yourname.kdb ~/Dropbox/
#+END_SRC
