  - A top level entry
  - An active day stamp without time
  - At least a day tag
- org file must have you name in the title
- must have org header entries for author and emacs

* Introduction

There are many reasons why you might keep a work log.  The most
important reasons to capture what you have done and learned are
likely:

- Have it be easier to do the same task in the future
- Document exactly how you did something.  The devil is in the
  details.
- Stop trying to keep everything in your head.
