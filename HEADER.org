* 2011 Research Tools

These chapters are being created for the 2011 Research Tools course.
They are extremely rough.  If you give them a read, I would appreciate
any kind of feedback that you are willing to offer.  The goal is to
give students skills that will help them conquer data throughout their
career.  I am hoping to get this wrapped together as a book that
people can take with them when they leave CCOM.  I will be releasing
it under a creative commons non-commercial license, so that you can
pass copies to your co-workers.
