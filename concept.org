- Start by giving them the NOAA and ACOE survey manuals
- Need to cover svn
- Can I do emacs and org mode?
- Handling references.  Monica on JabRef and Zotero
- Can I have them use python and provided readers for formats to read
  lidar, simrad em, single beam, etc to make google earth KML files?
- Can we incorporate Jonathan B's simrad parsing course or at least
  lead up to it?
- QGIS for sure, but maybe even a little GRASS?  And the others like
  uDig?
- Can the python lead towards using python in ArcGIS?
- How can I incorporate databases into the course?
- How do I lead into matlab?
- Time: windows time protocol, timed, ntp, ptp, GMT vrs UTC

Talked to Will about the idea of a linux server.  He suggested that we
cookup a VM for each student that runs linux with gmt/mbsystem/etc all
in there.  He likes the idea of python to really get the students
going on programming in a friendly, but informative way with OOP etc.

The goal of this course is to give first year graduate students a
background in data processing and visualization that will assist them
in their other course work at UNH.  CCOM will provide Windows
workstations in the classroom that will run allow students to run
local software and log into server running Linux.  Students will gain
experience in editing files, parsing data, electronic science logs,
simple databases using SQLite and PostGIS, plotting, scripting with
the BASH shell and Python, KML for Google Earth, GeoMapApp,
Fledermaus, MATLAB, and GIS tools including proj, uDIG, QGIS, and
ArcGIS.  Due to the time constraints, students will not go into depth
on these tools - the class will attempt to give the students a basis
upon which they can build their skills.

Examples for the class will be primarily focus on the Seacoast, NH
area in order to familiarize students taking the Summer Hydro course
with their field area.

- Introduction
  - Go over course goals
  - CCOM Wiki - Both as a source of material and adding content
  - The NOAA and ACOE survey manuals, NOS Survey Specifications,
    CoastPilot Manual (if we can get NOAA permission),  [[http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/CB/C13_Index.htm][IHO C-13]]
    Manual on Hydrography, etc. - We
    will not follow these, but students should compare and contrast
    what they do in their courses with these documents
  - Kickstart a class project.  Candidates:
    - Writing a wikipedia entry for one of the relevant
      pages that is weak or does not exist
  - Group chat for during class and after hours - IRC
- Introduction to the Linux VM - Logging in and getting started
  - ssh, scp, sftp
  - Basic shell commands and shell script
  - Editing with Emacs
  - Revision control with Subversion (svn)
  - Keeping a log book with Emacs and org-mode
  - Creating very basic HTML web pages using UNH Pub Pages or internal
    demo server
  - Inspecting data files and the difference between ASCII and binary data
- Introduction to databases using SQLite
  - Simple queries with SELECT from existing databases
  - Creating a new database with CREATE and INSERT
  - Global borehole catalog
  - Make a KML of the borehole plots using a shell script and SQLite

  - Parsing NMEA with python (ZDA and GGA strings)
- Tide lab using Python
  - Computing 6 minute averages from high rate tide sensors
  - Comparing tide sensors
  - Plotting using matplotlib
- Introduction to GIS concepts
  - Using uDig and Quantum GIS
  - Reading in points, lines, areas, shape files, 
  - Projection and vertical datum transformations using pyproj (and
    possibly NOAA's vdatum)
- Mapping from the command line
  - GMT map generation and GDAL transformations
  - Line: Plot ship tracks from multibeam files
  - Grids - GMT grids, BAGs
- Metadata
  - What are the FGDC and ISO 19115 standards? (Just a simplistic view)
  - Create a metadata file for a sample survey file
  - Python and XML
  - Create a Google Earth visualization from a sample set of metadata files
- Research Papers
  - Electronic Library Resources at UNH, Google Scholar
  - Personal journal management with Zotero and/or JabRef
  - Mention EndNote and Papers
  - A light introduction to LaTeX
- GeoMapApp
  - Guest Lecture by Andrew Goodwillie
- Fledermaus
  - Guest Lecture by Gee / Hefron (IVS)
- Introduction to Matlab
  - Start the basics using Octave, then show them that they can switch
    right to Matlab
  - Especially reading data from SQLite databases
- GIS Practical with ArcGIS
  - Guest ESRI or Mike Routhier from Morse Hall
  - I hope that we can leverage students' python and PostGIS experience
    from before

If there is time:

- Parsing a multibeam file using python or Jonathan's parsing
  multibeam with C

Possible addition if someone could provide it and there is time:

- Quick introduction to statistical analysis
  - Using http://cran.R-project.org/
  - Accessing R from python
