- Start by giving them the NOAA and ACOE survey manuals
- Need to cover svn
- Can I do emacs and org mode?
- Handling references.  Monica on JabRef and Zotero
- Can I have them use python and provided readers for formats to read
  lidar, simrad em, single beam, etc to make google earth KML files?
- Can we incorporate Jonathan B's simrad parsing course or at least
  lead up to it?

Talked to Will about the idea of a linux server.  He suggested that we
cookup a VM for each student that runs linux with gmt/mbsystem/etc all
in there.  He likes the idea of python to really get the students
going on programming in a friendly, but informative way with OOP etc.
